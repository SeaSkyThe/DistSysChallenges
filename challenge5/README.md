# Challenge \#5 - [Kafka-Style Log](https://fly.io/dist-sys/5a/)

In this challenge, you’ll need to implement a replicated log service similar to Kafka. Replicated logs are often used as a message bus or an event stream.
This challenge is broken up in multiple sections so that you can build out your system incrementally.

## Part A

First, we’ll start out with a single-node log system and then we’ll distribute it in later challenges.

### Solution

### Run

1. Install this package in your machine: `go install .`
2. Run the `malestrom` test: `maelstrom test -w kafka --bin ~/go/bin/challenge5 --node-count 1 --concurrency 2n --time-limit 20 --rate 1000`

Or, you prefer using Makefiles: `make a`
