# DistSysChallenges

Those are my solutions to the Fly.io Distributed Systems challenges (<https://fly.io/dist-sys/>).

## Setup

Basically you have to have the `maelstrom` utilitary in
your machine you can find it [here](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/01-getting-ready/index.md).

Its good to have [Go](https://go.dev/) as well.

## Structure

The Fly.io Distributed Systems Challenges has a total of 6 challenges,
each one of those challenges will be in a separate folder in this repo.
